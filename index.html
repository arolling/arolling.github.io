                  <p>On this page we simply fixed the spacing, indentation, and tag placement errors in web page for a cookie recipe.</p>

                  <p>This set of five interlinked pages was intended to demonstrate the use of two <span class="lang">different CSS style sheets</span> on the same basic content.</p>

                  <p>We created a basic webpage for a quirky local cupcake seller using <span class="lang">HTML</span> and <span class="lang">CSS</span> to practice adding links, images, and <span class="lang">CSS styles</span> to different elements.</p>

                  <p>This webpage about the fascinating field of slug racing used div tags to assign <span class="lang">CSS classes</span> to different portions of the <span class="lang">HTML</span> page.</p>

                  <p>We created a blog to cover the extremely important topic of presidential candidates' dogs and how they relate to their master's personality. This allowed us to practice adding attributes via <span class="lang">CSS</span> to different areas of the page and changing the layout easily.</p>

                  <p>We practiced creating three columns using <span class="lang">div</span> and <span class="lang">float</span> to show off the interior decorating skills of a truly talented designer.</p>

                  <p>Using <span class="lang">nesting</span> in <span class="lang">CSS,</span> we created a website for needy rescued exotic animals. It uses <span class="lang">media queries</span> to adjust the layout of the columns for different screen sizes.</p>

                  <p>In order to create a fan website for our favorite band, we used <span class="lang">float</span> to create a sidebar and organize our band member photos and biographies. Later, we used <span class="lang">media queries</span> to modify the page layout for printing.</p>

                  <p>Using <span class="lang">Bootstrap,</span> we created a website advertising North Korea as a fun tourist spot. We created four columns of content that change with the viewport size and a carousel at the top to display additional photos.</p>

<!--There is WAY TOO MUCH about me below!! -->

          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>I have a <em>slightly</em> unusual background in that I feel like I belong equally to two countries. My British father and American mother met and married in Vancouver, BC, Canada and I was born in the suburb of Richmond. They were originally co-workers at a Canadian airline in the IT department (although they didn't call it that in the 1970s), one as a computer analyst and the other as a programmer. We moved to Vancouver, Washington (confusingly) when I was 9 years old; after High School, some college, and working for a year or so I moved to Victoria, BC and lived there for almost 13 years, returning to the US in November 2015. I have two older brothers, one in Haiti and one in LA, and a fraternal twin sister who lives in Vancouver with her husband and two toddlers.</p>
          <p>While I worked for a time as a real estate assistant, most of my career has been spent as a pharmacy assistant/technician in small community pharmacies. Many people <strong>don't know</strong> that the majority of the people working behind the counter in a dispensary are not actually pharmacists. To become a registered, legal pharmacist requires five to seven years of post-secondary education, multiple exams and evaluations, and ongoing professional development and continuing education. Generally a small or medium sized pharmacy includes one or two pharmacists working at any time it is open with one to three support personnel operating under them. The technician role requires precision and efficiency along with strong customer service skills and flexibility.</p>
          <p>I didn't intend to work in pharmacy - I studied computer science in University - and when it came time to look for a new job in Victoria I decided to make a major life change by returning to my "hometown" of Vancouver to be closer to family and launch a new career in programming. I believe that my experience in the medical/pharmaceutical field could be useful to many companies trying to develop tools for that market.</p>
