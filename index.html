<!--There is WAY TOO MUCH about me below!! -->

          <h5>Background</h5>
          <p>I have a slightly unusual background in that I feel like I belong equally to two countries. My British father and American mother met and married in Vancouver, BC, Canada and I was born in the suburb of Richmond. They were originally co-workers at a Canadian airline in the IT department (although they didn't call it that in the 1970s), one as a computer analyst and the other as a programmer. We moved to Vancouver, Washington (confusingly) when I was 9 years old; after High School, some college, and working for a year or so I moved to Victoria, BC and lived there for almost 13 years, returning to the US in November 2015.</p>
          <p>While I spent some time working as a real estate assistant, most of my career has been spent as a pharmacy assistant/technician in small community pharmacies. Many people don't know that the majority of the people working behind the counter in a dispensary are not actually pharmacists. To become a registered, legal pharmacist requires five to seven years of post-secondary education, multiple exams and evaluations, and ongoing professional development and continuing education. Generally a small or medium sized pharmacy includes one or two pharmacists working at any time it is open with one to three support personnel operating under them. The technician role requires precision and efficiency along with strong customer service skills and flexibility.</p>
          <p>I didn't intend to work in pharmacy - I studied computer science in University - and when it came time to look for a new job in Victoria I decided to make a major life change by returning to my "hometown" of Vancouver to be closer to family and launch a new career in programming. I believe that my experience in the medical/pharmaceutical field could be useful to many companies trying to develop tools for that market.</p>
