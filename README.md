## Description

This webpage links to all the sites I've helped produce in my first week at Epicodus, demonstrating all the skills I've acquired so far.

## Known Bugs

The contact form opened by the modal call does not currently work - apparently this is only implementable using php. The button below it does open a blank e-mail correctly instead. The navigation bar doesn't retract after being used in smaller viewports, concealing content, but as far as I can tell this is the expected behavior.

## Support and contact details

[E-mail me](mailto:arolling@gmail.com) with any comments or concerns.
